KreweServer
--
The contents of the KreweServer Directory are the surrounding source 
and running scripts for the server side component of the KreweMessenger Application


- The Server module acts as seperate executable that is designed to run on dedicated machine or port-forwarded host. 
- The server and client communciate via a datagram (UDP) protocol, thus any firewall or connection prohibiting constraints 
will have to be kept in mind for the active port that the KreweServer will operate on.
