# KreweMessenger-Server
Customizable Messenger Client. Messing with UDP and server connection states.
 
A fun little project in learning the intricacies of UDP and TCP like connection protocols and applying to a chatroom/messenger application.
This project involved developing the client and server side applications. 

**Fun/Quirky Features:**
1) User customizable interface with color picking 
2) Color preset loading/saving 
3) little 'ding' sound when you've got a new message and your window is minimized!
